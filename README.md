# Mitron-Bank-Strategic-Insights
This project is a Personal Finance Analytics Dashboard designed to provide the detailed analytical insights to management of Mitron Bank using various dashboards for different domains in banking like: Income & spend analysis and other demographics of the customers of various age groups.

## üìù Project Overview
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. This project provides users and analysts with clear, interactive, and data-driven insights into individual financial behavior. It integrates demographic data, income distribution, and spending habits to create a unified visual platform that aids in financial planning, analysis, and reporting through interactive charts, graphs, and tables.

## Problem Statement
Understanding financial behavior is challenging without a centralized, visual representation of income and expenditure data. Most individuals or businesses lack tools that integrate multiple financial data points into a single view. This project addresses that gap by:

- Consolidating demographic, income, and expense data.
- Presenting data in an interactive, intuitive visual format.
- Offering actionable insights to support smarter financial decisions. The goal is to simplify financial analysis and make personal or business finances more transparent and manageable.
## üîë Key Terms
- Demographics: User attributes such as age group, gender, and marital status, used to segment financial trends.
- Income Analysis: Visual representation of income distribution across users, categorized into income ranges and frequency.
- Spend Analysis: Breakdown of expenditure patterns over time and by category (e.g., travel, groceries, utilities).
- Detailed View: A user-level tabular representation of key financial data for deeper drill-down analysis.
- KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): High-level metrics like total users, average income, total spend, and savings rate, offering quick financial health snapshots.
## üíª Tech Stack
- Tableau Desktop: To create visuals from rew data.
- Excel & Power Query: For data preprocessing.
- SQL: For loading & preprocessing data.
